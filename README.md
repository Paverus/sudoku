# sudoku
This git contains a sudoku solver written in C++ that utilizes a combination of set combinations and backtracking depth first recursion to solve sudokus.
The sudoku solver allows the user to input a sudoku of their own by stating which number should go in which row and column, and is entirely text based. Otherwise the program will output a prewritten sudoku, solve it and print the solution.
The solver contains 3 classes, with the grid class being the main class and the location and numSet classes being dependencies for grid.
Each file contains comments detailing the use for each function.
